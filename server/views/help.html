				<h3>General</h3>
				<p>To open a user profile, select a researcher from the dropdown menu on the <a class="textlink" href="index.html">start page</a>. 
				You are forwarded to the start dialog displaying all competences in a pie chart and a table. The top menu contains further entries to inspect the profile.
				</div>
			<div class="row">
				<h3>Pie chart</h3>
				<p>The user profile is visualized in a pie chart. Each pie slice represents a competence entry. The width of the pie slice corresponds to frequency the competence appears in the analyzed publications. 
				Hover over a pie slice to see the competence name. Double click on a pie slice to get further information obtained from <a class="textlink" href="https://wiki.dbpedia.org/" target="_blanck">DBpedia</a>. 
				A double click on a pie slice also leads to more provenance information and lists phrases and sentences of the publications from which the competences have been extracted.
				In addition, the publication title and (if available) the DOI is provided.
				<br>
				The color of each pie slice depends on the category of the concept. 
				For each competence entry, we try to get a matching category from the Computer Science Ontology (CSO). 
				If two or more competences share a category, they are colored in the same color. 
				If no category could be obtained from the CSO ontology, the competence is colored in grey.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<h3>Force-directed chart</h3>
				<p>Force-directed chart visualizes the user profile as a graph to inspect the diversity of the profile entries and their semantic similarity and relatedness.
				Each node of the chart represents a competence and the lines between the nodes correspond 
				to the semantic similarity/relatedness between the competences.
				By default the first eight competence entries are displayed. To see more or other combinations of competences check or uncheck the DBpedia URIs and click the 'reload graph' button above the table. 
				Click on a node to display all nodes and lines that are connected to the selected node. 
				Click on this node again to return to the default view.<br>
				The similarity and relatedness between to DBpedia URIs are computed using the <a class="textlink" href="https://github.com/gsi-upm/sematch" target="_blanck"> Python sematch library</a>. 
				If both, the similarity and relatedness, are larger than zero the average of both values is used. If only one value is larger than zero, the non-zero value one is taken.<br>
				This computed value is used to draw a line between the DBpedia URIs: a solid line represents a strong similarity/relatedness, a dashed line represents a medium similarity/relatedness, and a dotted line represents a low similarity/relatedness. 
				Hover over a line to display all three values. Click on the button below and change the default thresholds for each line. <br>
				The color of each node depends on the category of the concept. If two or more competences share a category, they are colored in the same color. 
				If no category could be obtained from the CSO ontology, the competence is colored in grey.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<h3>Chord chart</h3>
				<p>The third visualization displays the user profile as a chord chart. 
				The chord chart is similiar to the force-directed graph. 
				The outer arcs display the competences while each line between the arcs corresponds to the similarity/relatedness between the competences. 
				By default only the first eight competences are displayed. 
				To see more or other combinations of competences check or uncheck the wanted concepts and click the 'reload graph' button above the table.<br>
				The similarity and relatedness values are computed by means of the <a class="textlink" href="https://github.com/gsi-upm/sematch" target="_blanck"> Python sematch library</a>. 
				If both, the similarity and relatedness, are larger than zero the average of both values is used. If only one value is larger than zero, the non-zero value one is taken.<br>
				The higher the returned value, the stronger the connection between the two competences is.<br>
